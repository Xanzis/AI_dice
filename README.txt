This doc should describe what all the fiels here do. Most importantly it should be used to figure out what was used to train what.

rand_v_rand_sd.ts : Generated by two random functions. If there's a clear option, ideal is that option. Else choose value of own die.
ai1_sd : Trained with rand_v_rand_sd.ts and, disappointingly, appeared to be biased towards tails. 
aisd_v_aisd_test.ts : Generated by two ai1_sd functions. Sadly, 73% of ideals are tails.
ai2_sd : trained on aisd_v_aisd_test.ts and produces far majority tails bets. New direction chosen for next set of trains.

Goal now in progress: get a network to first figure out the die, then start biasing towards playing the game well. We'll see what works best here with time.

rvr_guessown.ts : data produced with rand v rand, but ideals are just the value of the bot's die. Good balance of even / odd (ofc)
ai_guessown : trained on rvr_guessown.ts and achieves 66% success. 
more coming soon ...
